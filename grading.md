# Instructor Comments

Generally good, but note the following:

 - Always use a __main__ block for executable code. If you want to run a block of code conveniently, define it inside a function inside your module, and call that function explicitly.
 - Never use the input() command. No production code should request input from a user. If you want interactivity, embed your code inside a notebook that someone can modify.
 - Remember docstrings!  See the python template file in the info repository for style guidance.
 - See the Jupyter template in the info repository for ideas on how to style your notebook.
